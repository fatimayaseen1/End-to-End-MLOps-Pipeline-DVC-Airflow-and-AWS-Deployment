Developed a comprehensive MLOps ecosystem that automates the entire ML lifecycle. The system utilizes DVC (Data Version Control) to manage datasets and training pipelines, ensuring full reproducibility. I implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions for automated unit testing and linting, and containerized the solution using Docker for consistent deployment.

**Workflow Automation & Orchestration:**

**Airflow Integration:** Engineered an automated DAG in Apache Airflow to orchestrate data loading, training, and logging tasks.

**Inference API:** Developed a RESTful API using FastAPI to serve model predictions, fully containerized and tested via Postman.

**Cloud Deployment:** AWS Infrastructure: Successfully deployed the containerized API to an AWS EC2 instance, utilizing S3 for cloud-based data storage. The final product is a publicly accessible endpoint capable of serving real-time model inferences.

**Technical Skills**
**Orchestration & Versioning:** Apache Airflow, DVC (Data Version Control).

**Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (EC2, S3), Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

**API Development:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, RESTful Web Services.

**Engineering Tools:** Git, Python, Unit Testing (Pytest)
